"Large unidentified trade convoys have been detected on various fringe colonies across the core worlds, the combination of their lack of transponder signature and an unusually low engine emissions has made their detection rare but there are enough similar reports to rule out a band of smugglers.
The frequent use of Atlas and Prometheus hulls suggest they fare from a polity on the fringes of the Persean Sector, a suggestion reinforced by the tendency towards low-tech hulls which require less specialized equipment and rare materials to build and maintain.
Further inquiry is recommended to determine the nature and scale of this threat to league interests."
-League Intelligence report on unidentified vessels N°3852-E

Adds a faction with their own versions of existing ships, system and lore deep in uncharted space.

Ships:
Kang ships are variants of vanilla ships that are very defensive, swapping every ship's systems with the Damper Field system, their modular construction gives them a guaranteed recovery chance, slower CR degradation and built in Insulated Engine Assembly + Distributed Fire Control.
Inherent weaknesses: Distributed Fire Control means no range hullmods, Kang Doctrine means higher D-Mod chance on destruction.
Doctrine weakness: Kang ships are never equipped with speed hullmods or beams.
They are intended to be a bit stronger than their default versions when the AI uses them but not so much for the player.

Systems:
New system for you to find.

Lore:
Is for the most part currently unimplemented beyond planet/market descriptions, will come at a later time.

Requirements:
None

Has compatibility with:
Nexerelin
Commissioned Crews: Unique Hullmod.
Industrial Evolution: Supports ships, ambassador and some markets spawn with more non-industry buildings. (for flavor, not to buff)
Combat Chatter: There’s unique dialogue for each type of officer personality.
